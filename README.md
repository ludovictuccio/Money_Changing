# Money_Changing

This app is about giving change. <br/>

----

First, you must enter the article price. And after, set your given money for the change. <br/>

The result tells us the number of banknotes, coins and cents that you must return to the client, trying to be as productive as possible by making only a minimum of money possible. <br/>

BigDecimal is used, for money manipulation to avoid loss of precision. <br/>

----

## **Example** <br/>
